# Evaluating methods for reconstructing large gaps in historic snow depth time series

Source code for the manuscript:

"Aschauer, J., Marty, C.: Evaluating methods for reconstructing large gaps in historic snow depth time series,
GI, 2021."

Methods for the gap reconstruction are defined in the main module 
`./src/gap_modeling.py`.

The two scripts `./src/cross_validation_script.py` and `./src/influence_of_number_of_stations.py` perform the analysis.

The script `./src/cross_validation_evaluation_script.py` produces figures and from cached results after the two above mentioned scripts have been run.

Input data is available upon request.
